## 📢 About Me
Hi, my name is Miguel Salcedo. I am currently working as a Software Developer at [<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-dark.svg" alt="GitHub" width="16" height="16"/>](https://github.com/). Before that, I worked at [<img src="https://www.amazon.com/favicon.ico" alt="Amazon" width="16" height="16"/>](https://a.co) for close to 6 years.

## 🎮 Hobbies
I love to program on my latest idea, watch anime and play video games. Although my 👶 daughter monopolizes most of my time during the day, I still often spend my nights in front of a 💻 or 📺 screen. I start most of my mornings with a cup of ☕ and will have 1 or 2 more before the day is done.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't remember the last time I read a book that was **not** software-related. Though, I do know it was a book in the Witcher series.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In the order I learned them, I speak: _Español_, _English_ and some _日本語_.

## 📋 My Projects
* [Tortuaga](https://tortuga.salcedo.cc) 🐢 - A functional programming language -- built for concurrency -- that compiles to WebAssembly.
* [PPP](https://github.com/misalcedo/ppp) 💻 - An [HAProxy Protocol](xy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) Parser written in Rust. Parses versions 1 and 2 of the protocol.
* [WASM-AST](https://github.com/misalcedo/wasm-ast) 🕸️ - A WebAssembly Abstract Syntax Tree. Meant to ease WebAssembly code-generation for compilers written in Rust.
* [Literate-rs](https://github.com/misalcedo/literate-rs) 📔 - A [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) tool that extracts the contents of [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) files.
